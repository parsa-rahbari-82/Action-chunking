# Action Chunking with Q-Learning on FrozenLake

This repository demonstrates the use of **action chunking** (macro actions) in a Q-learning agent trained on the `FrozenLake-v1` environment from OpenAI Gym.

## TODOs & Limitations

**Scalability** : Generating all combinations of macro actions is impractical for large action spaces.

**Generalization** : The current implementation only works with deterministic FrozenLake.
